\title{V-center a Matrix}
\usage{
v_center(A)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{A numeric matrix to be V-centered}
}
\value{
A V-centered matrix of the same dimensions as the input
}
\description{
Performs V-centering on a matrix by subtracting row means, column means,
and adding the overall mean. V-centering is a technique used in various
statistical methods including distance covariance, HSIC, and kernel-based
independence tests.
}
\details{
For a matrix A, the V-centered matrix is calculated as:

V(A) = A - row_means - col_means + total_mean

where row_means is a matrix where each element in row i is the mean of row i in A,
col_means is a matrix where each element in column j is the mean of column j in A,
and total_mean is the overall mean of all elements in A.

This function uses an efficient Rcpp implementation for improved performance,
which is particularly beneficial for large matrices.
}
\examples{
# Create a sample matrix
set.seed(123)
A <- matrix(rnorm(100), nrow = 10)

# Apply V-centering
A_centered <- v_center(A)

# Verify properties of V-centered matrix
# Row sums should be approximately zero
row_sums <- rowSums(A_centered)
print(round(row_sums, 10))

# Column sums should be approximately zero
col_sums <- colSums(A_centered)
print(round(col_sums, 10))

# Total sum should be approximately zero
total_sum <- sum(A_centered)
print(round(total_sum, 10))

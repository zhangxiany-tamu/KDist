\arguments{
\item{x}{Predictor matrix, where each column represents a variable and each row an observation}

\item{y}{Response variable (vector) or matrix with a single column}

\item{type}{Type of kernel or distance to use for the predictor (default: "euclidean").
Options include "euclidean", "polynomial", "gaussian", "laplacian", "e-dist",
"g-dist", or "l-dist".}

\item{bw}{Bandwidth parameter for kernel distances. If NULL, it will be automatically determined.}

\value{
An object of class "mdd_hd_test" containing:
\item{statistic}{The test statistic value}

\item{n}{Sample size}
\item{p}{Number of predictor variables}
}
\description{
Performs a high-dimensional test for conditional mean independence based on the
Martingale Difference Divergence. This implementation is optimized for large datasets
using parallel processing.
}
\details{
The high-dimensional MDD test is designed specifically for settings where the number
of predictors is large, potentially even larger than the sample size. It uses a
modified test statistic that accounts for high-dimensional effects and follows a
standard normal distribution under the null hypothesis, enabling analytical p-value
calculation without requiring bootstrap procedures.

This implementation is based on the methodology described in Zhang, Yao, & Shao (2018),
which provides a framework for testing conditional mean dependence in high dimensions
using a standardized version of the Martingale Difference Divergence. The test is
particularly effective for detecting conditional mean dependence structures in
high-dimensional settings where traditional methods may fail.

\examples{
# Example: High-dimensional data with conditional mean dependence
set.seed(123)
n <- 100
p <- 50  # High-dimensional setting

# Generate predictor variables
x <- matrix(rnorm(n * p), nrow = n, ncol = p)

# Generate response with conditional mean dependence on first predictor
y <- x[,1]^2 + 0.5 * rnorm(n)

# Perform high-dimensional MDD test
test_result <- mdd_hd_test(x, y)
print(test_result)

\title{Calculate Statistics Recursively for Change Point Detection}
\usage{
.stat_recur(full_dist, type)
}
\arguments{
\item{full_dist}{Full distance/kernel matrix computed from the input data}

\item{type}{Type of distance or kernel ("euclidean", "gaussian", etc.)}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{statistic}{Maximum test statistic value}
\item{change_point}{Estimated change point location}
\item{all_statistics}{Vector of test statistics for all potential change points}
}
\description{
Internal function that calculates test statistics for various potential change point
locations. This implements the kernel-based test statistic calculation as described in
Chakraborty & Zhang (2021).
}
\details{
This function computes the test statistics for all possible change point locations by:
\enumerate{
\item Calculating MMD (Maximum Mean Discrepancy) values
\item Computing HSIC (Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion) components
\item Combining these to form the final test statistic
}

The implementation uses efficient recursion strategies and C++ implementations for
computationally intensive parts.

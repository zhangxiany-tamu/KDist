\title{Calculate MMD Recursively for Change Point Detection}
\usage{
.mmd_recur(full_dist, type)
}
\arguments{
\item{full_dist}{Full distance/kernel matrix computed from the input data}

\item{type}{Type of distance or kernel ("euclidean", "gaussian", etc.)}
}
\value{
A vector of MMD values for all potential change points
}
\description{
Internal function that calculates Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) values recursively
for all potential change point locations.
}
\details{
This function computes MMD values by calculating partial averages of kernel/distance
matrix elements using efficient C++ implementations. The computation differs based
on whether the input is a distance-based or kernel-based metric.

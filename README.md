# KDistTest: Kernel-Based Distance Methods for Statistical Testing

## Overview

KDistTest is a comprehensive R package for kernel-based distance methods in statistical testing. It implements a wide range of non-parametric tests using distance and kernel-based approaches, including:

- Generalized Energy Distance
- Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)
- Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC)
- Joint HSIC
- Distance-based MANOVA
- Conditional Independence Testing
- Change-point Detection

These methods are particularly useful for high-dimensional data analysis, testing independence between random variables, multivariate hypothesis testing, and detecting structural changes in sequential data.

## Installation

You can install the development version from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("YourUsername/KDistTest")
```

## Key Features

- **Flexible Distance Metrics**: Various distance and kernel options including Euclidean, Gaussian, Laplacian, and more.
- **High-dimensional Testing**: Methods optimized for high-dimensional settings.
- **Parallel Computing**: Support for parallel processing to speed up permutation tests.
- **Change-point Detection**: Binary segmentation methods for multiple change-point detection.
- **Conditional Testing**: Tests for conditional independence and conditional distribution differences.

## Examples

### Two-Sample Testing

```r
# Generate two samples
set.seed(123)
n <- 100
p <- 10
x <- matrix(rnorm(n*p), n, p)
y <- matrix(rnorm(n*p, mean = 0.5), n, p)

# MMD test
result <- mmd_test(x, y, type = "gaussian", n_perm = 199)
print(result)
plot(result)
```

### Independence Testing

```r
# Generate dependent data
set.seed(456)
n <- 200
x <- matrix(rnorm(n*2), n, 2)
y <- x + matrix(rnorm(n*2, sd = 0.5), n, 2)

# HSIC test
result <- hsic_test(x, y, type = "gaussian", n_perm = 199)
print(result)
```

### Distance-based MANOVA

```r
# Create example data
set.seed(789)
n <- 100
p <- 5
group <- rep(1:2, each = n/2)
x <- matrix(0, n, p)
x[group == 1, ] <- matrix(rnorm(n/2*p), n/2, p)
x[group == 2, ] <- matrix(rnorm(n/2*p, mean = 0.8), n/2, p)
data <- data.frame(y = x, group = as.factor(group))

# Distance-based MANOVA
out <- dmanova(y ~ group, data = data, method = "permutation", n_perm = 99)
print(out$aov.tab)
```

### Change-point Detection

```r
# Generate data with change point
set.seed(123)
n <- 200
cp <- 100  # True change point
data1 <- matrix(rnorm(cp*5), cp, 5)
data2 <- matrix(rnorm(cp*5, mean = 0.8), cp, 5) 
data <- rbind(data1, data2)

# Detect single change point
result <- kcpd_single(data, type = "e-dist", method = "permutation", B = 99)
print(result)
```

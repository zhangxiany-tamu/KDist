Description: This package offers a comprehensive toolkit for kernel and distance-based methods in statistical inference. It implements various statistical inference procedures based on generalized energy distance, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), generalized distance covariance, and the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). It also features dHSIC, high-order HSIC, joint HSIC, kernel/distance-based MANOVA, and high-dimensional independence/two-sample t-tests. The toolkit also includes methods for conditional independence/two-sample testing, as well as change-point detection.
